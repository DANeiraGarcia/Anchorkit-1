//! Measures how much `attest_batch` saves over N individual `attest` calls,
//! across a range of batch sizes, to find where the savings level off (and
//! the hard batch-size ceiling imposed by Soroban's per-invocation ledger
//! footprint limits).
//!
//! Run with `cargo test batch_gas_benchmark -- --nocapture` to see the
//! printed tables; results are summarized in the README's "Batch
//! attestation gas amortization" section.
//!
//! Each `attest` call pays a fixed per-invocation cost (auth check,
//! allow-list lookup, pause check) plus a variable per-entry cost (storage
//! write, TTL math, event). `attest_batch` pays the fixed cost once and the
//! variable cost N times, so its per-entry cost should approach the
//! variable-only cost as batch size grows, while individual calls always
//! pay fixed+variable per entry.
